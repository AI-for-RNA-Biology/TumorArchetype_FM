Your HF access tokens should remain private, never share them. You can also set your HuggingFace 
read-only token as an environment variable: export HF_TOKEN=<MY_READ_ONLY_TOKEN>. If set, this value 
will overwrite the token stored on the machine (in either $HF_TOKEN_PATH or "$HF_HOME/token" if the 
former is not set).
